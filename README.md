# Academic Projects Repository

This repository serves as a structured collection of academic and independent projects developed during my AAS in Computer Software, BSc in Software Engineering, and two separate MSc programs—1st MSc in Computer Systems Architecture and 2nd MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics—as well as postgraduate independent research work.

The materials are organized by academic level and subject area to ensure clarity, traceability, and long-term reference.

The following sections provide additional notes on specific academic levels, technical limitations, and usage policies.

### 💠 Notes

Course-related materials are preserved in their original structure.
Independent research projects are clearly separated from coursework.
Some folders may contain experimental, archived, or reference materials.

### 💠 BSc Final Project Notes

The Bachelor's final project involved a complete structural and behavioral implementation of the Mano Basic Computer architecture using the VHDL hardware description language. The design was based on M. Morris Mano’s architecture and was simulated using ModelSim.

The corresponding testbench and project report files are not included in this repository.
For academic inquiries or access requests, please contact the author directly.

### 💠 Thesis Notice

The 1st MSc thesis is referenced in this repository for completeness of the academic record. The thesis focuses on **Power–Delay Product (PDP) optimization in VLSI arithmetic circuits using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms**.

Due to institutional and supervisory restrictions, the thesis document, source codes, and related materials are not publicly available and are therefore not included in this repository.
